# Cab Booking App

Welcome to my Cab Booking App project! This application is built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). It provides users with a seamless experience to book cabs with various options and price ranges, ensuring quick and efficient travel to their destinations.

## Features

- **Dijkstra's Algorithm Implementation**: The project incorporates Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path between locations, ensuring efficient routing for users.
- **Interactive UI**: The user interface is designed to be interactive, intuitive, and completely responsive across devices, enhancing user experience.
- **Real-time Updates**: Upon booking, users receive real-time updates via React-toastify, making their interaction with the app more engaging and informative.

## Database

This application utilizes MongoDB as its database solution. MongoDB is a NoSQL database that offers flexibility, scalability, and performance. It stores data in JSON-like documents, making it easy to work with and suitable for a wide range of applications. With MongoDB, we ensure efficient data storage and retrieval, facilitating smooth operation of the Cab Booking App.
